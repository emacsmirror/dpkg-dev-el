Comment:
 This collection of files was assembled by Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>
 from various messages posted on the gnu.emacs.sources newsgroup, as well as
 from various collections of Emacs Lisp files found on the web.  Some
 authors contacted Roland directly, some users sent me the files by email.
 Most of them are covered by the GNU GPL, but the individual licences can
 vary.

Comment:
 Packaging was completely re-done with 37.0, taking only debian/copyright
 and (part of) debian/control from emacs-goodies-el.
